# rule-reco
Interpretable rule-based modeling with imodels, adaptable to domains like credit risk scorecards.

## Description

This repository explores the use of the imodels package to generate interpretable rule-based models from labeled prediction datasets. The goal is to recommend human-readable rules that capture the relationships between features and outcomes, providing both predictive performance and interpretability.

The workflow demonstrates:

- Loading and preparing a labeled dataset.

- Applying rule-based learners from the imodels package (e.g., RuleFit, RuleList, DecisionSets).

- Extracting and ranking the learned rules according to their importance or predictive contribution.

- Presenting the rules in a way that can be used for decision support, risk assessment, or feature understanding.

By combining model interpretability with predictive modeling, this project highlights how rule-based approaches can be leveraged for transparent machine learning and explainable AI applications.
